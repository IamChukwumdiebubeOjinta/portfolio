              I'm a product-focused full-stack engineer based in Nigeria,
              passionate about crafting highly interactive, intelligent web
              applications. While I thrive in front-end architecture and DX
              (Remix, React, Tailwind), I'm just as comfortable building complex
              AI-powered systems, designing backend APIs, or scaling cloud
              infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p className='text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              I enjoy leading projects that mix user experience, system design,
              and AI. Recently, I've led the development of{' '}
              <span className='text-primary font-medium'>Uloma</span> — a family
              historian and AI chat companion built on Vercel AI SDK, Prisma,
              and BullMQ — and I've worked with startups to transform their
              ideas into reality.
            </p>

            <p className='text-lg leading-relaxed'>
              Outside of code, I enjoy cooking, football, and building personal
              tools.
