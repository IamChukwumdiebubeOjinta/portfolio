                My journey in engineering started with a simple fascination: how
                do we make technology feel human? This question has driven every
                project I've worked on, from building AI-powered family
                storytelling tools to creating seamless user experiences that
                just <em>work</em>.
              </p>

              <p>
                I believe the best software is invisible‚Äîit solves problems so
                elegantly that users forget they're using technology at all.
                Whether I'm architecting a complex AI system or crafting a
                delightful frontend interaction, this philosophy guides every
                decision.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me experimenting with new
                recipes in the kitchen, analyzing football tactics, or building
                small tools that make my daily life a bit more efficient. I'm
                always curious about how things work and how they can work
                better.
